This program explores the median odds ratio, a measure of the size of a random effect in a random effects logistic regression model.

```{r preliminaries}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
```

This data set represents the number of cancer cells out of 400 that were killed by a radiation exposure. There were 27 experiments run, 3 per day across 9 different days.

```{r read-data}
f <- "http://www.statsci.org/data/general/radiatio.txt"
radiation <- read.table(file=f, header=TRUE)

print(radiation)
```

Let's plot the data. You'll notice something right away.

```{r plot}
radiation %>%
  ggplot(aes(Occasion, Survived)) +
  geom_point()
```

There is significant day-to-day variation. How would you model that variation?

```{r glm}
radiation %<>% mutate(p=Survived/400)
fixed_model <- glm(p~1, data=radiation, family=binomial)
summary(fixed_model)
```
